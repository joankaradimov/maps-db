# dev-server

This can be used to serve the the maps database in development. This allows
files to be loaded with relative paths (which is otherwise impossible with the
`file://` protocol). It also enables live reloading upon file editing.

## Usage

Do either of these:

- Open the Visual Studio solution and hit Ctrl+F5
- Navigate to `~/dev-server` and execute `app.js`
