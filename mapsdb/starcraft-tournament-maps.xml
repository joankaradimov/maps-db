        <description>
          Formerly known as Silver Wing, Fighting Spirit was one of the maps introduced for the 2009-2010 Proleague season. It is by far the most popular map on Fish Server, to the point many casual players will only play Fighting Spirit because it is the only map they have memorized.

          Fighting Spirit is one of the five maps used in the 2009-10 PokerStrategy.com TSL.

        <description>
          At first glance, (Neo) Jade in many ways resembles standard four-corner main base maps like Fighting Spirit or Circuit Breaker, which also share the nearby third base, but NJ does exhibit some notable features of its own. For example, the main is located on a lower elevation, making it vulnerable to attack, particularly from range units. This forces players to take their naturals early lest they run the risk of being contained in their main and fighting up a ramp.[1]

          A long natural ridge connects the natural to the third, making it easy to take an expansion and to defend alongside the natural, because the ramp typically contains reinforcement troops. The main attack path is a single narrow ramp that can be defended if not blocked. While they are easy to take, these thirds have low value gas geysers (only 1500 gas).

          Sniper Ridge was a map released in late 2011. Since the release of the revised version a few months later for the 2012 Tving OSL, New Sniper Ridge has largely replaced the original in terms of frequency of use. TLPD records show Sniper Ridge was used approximately 60 times, largely for Proleague games, while New Sniper Ridge has accumulated over 260 games as of October 2014. New Sniper Ridge is one of the more popular maps in terms of organized competitions and show matches.

          In reviewing the cumulative history of games played across TLPD Korean, International, and SOSPA, the map shows remarkable balance between the races:

        <name>815</name>
        <description>
          815 was the first map to introduce small ramps where only small units can pass through. Strategies used on this map were varied greatly due to the uniqueness of the map. Zerg tended to play similarly as on land maps, whereas Terran and Protoss played a more defensive island style games. Even though games tend to be drawn out, rushing and cheesing was also very popular on 815. The map name 815 comes from the date August the 15th (8/15), Liberation Day in Korea.

        <name>Outsider</name>
        <description>
          Outsider was introduced in the fourth round of the 2008-09 Shinhan Bank Proleague season as one of four new maps for the round. The main feature of the map is the ring of expansions along the edge of the map; with two ramps in the back of each main giving access to one side and a mineral only. However, what looks like a mineral only from the side of your main can be acquired as a Gas Expansion on the other side of the Mineral line, right next to this is the expansion accessible from one of the adjacent main bases. A player can also opt to place their expansion in between the two Gas geysers to increase Gas income while sacrificing the ability to easily mine Minerals. Most games involve some sort of harassment at the many expansions along the edge; Terran can drop Siege Tanks, Protoss can drop Reavers or build Cannons behind the Minerals, and Zerg can drop Lurkers or Hydras.

          When Outsider was first released in Proleague Round 4, many progamers jumped workers over the mineral lines to set up a relatively safe (from ground units) expansion. Without access from ground units, though, these expansions proved too vulnerable to drops, and many have settled with accessing the mineral-only first, then expanding between 2 vespene geysers late-game.

          Outsider SE is one of the five maps used in the 2009-10 PokerStrategy.com TSL.

        <description>
          Arcadia is a macro-oriented map with a wide center and most notably a very easy to take Mineral only expansion that is nestled near each start location's natural. Overall it is a very standard 4 player map. It was fairly balanced when used between 2006 and 2007, but is argued to be in favor of Terran for modern play (circa 2008).

        <description>
          Nostalgia is recognised as one of the most iconic "old school" maps, known to be a difficult map to strategize for. PvZ was the most famous match-up on this map as it required both sides to play a low gas style; Nostalgia was the first major map whose natural expansion did not have a Vespene geyser.

          There have also been many memorable TvZs played upon the map, involving many inventive plays by both sides, as well as groundbreaking series such as the end of [1] iloveoov's 27-0 TvZ streak and used in the XellOs vs YellOw 2003 Olympus OSL final.

          PvT is also not to be neglected, as many famous games were played on the map, including an infamous "mine daebak" by Reach versus Control on the last set of the 2004 Gillette OSL semifinal.

          Nostalgia is one of the maps with the most balanced records in all match-ups.

        <name>Longinus</name>
        <description>
          Longinus was introduced into the StarCraft scene in 2006 - when it appeared in the 2006 SKY Proleague, the Pringles MSL and the MBCGame Survivor League. In the second half of 2006, Longinus II was released, fixing balance issues such as natural expansion mineral placements, while also adding a second vespene geyser at the 1, 5, and 9 o'clock positions.

          Since then, Longinus has remained a popular map and is still often played in ladders such as iCCup and in special events. Longinus II is considered slightly imbalanced ZvP, as Protoss gets a big advantage with the double gas and easily securable expansions (whereas in Longinus I, the lack of a double gas expansion made it imbalanced in favor of Zerg). While it is balanced in TvP at the professional level, the balance is much worse in ZvT. The fact that it still has somewhat passable statistics in ZvT has largely been attributed to sAviOr; without him the map stands at a grim 11-27 ZvT (29%).

It quickly became one of the most popular maps played due to its simplicity and macro focused game play. Tau Cross was also a Courage map. It remained popular long after it was discontinued from Progaming use. Tau Cross was brought back for the 2009 Shinhan Bank Winners League and following GOMTV's policy of using only Proleague maps also subsequently used in the 2009 GOMTV Averatec-Intel Classic Season 3. The World Cyber Games also used Tau Cross for their Grand Final in Cologne in 2008.

This map was also used in the 2008-2009 Shinhan Bank Proleague, and the GomTV Avaratec-Intel Classic Season 2. The map is known to host many mech TvZ's as it favors Mech over standard Bionic play.

          This map is very popular for cheeses as well as proxies because of the short rush distances between the bases, as well as the fact that it is a two player map.

          Heartbreak Ridge was introduced in the fourth round of the 2008-09 Shinhan Bank Proleague season as one of four new maps for the round, and modified for the second round of the 2009-10 Shinhan Bank Proleague season. It continued to see action all the way up until 2010, leaving a string of memorable games behind.

          The third can be somewhat difficult to take as the walking distance is rather far, but the backdoor route into the third makes this a less drastic effect than it would otherwise be. Taking a fourth is a bigger problem, as the options for a fourth gas are directly above your opponent's base, in the center, or along a direct line from your opponent's natural. Map control is extremely important to securing resources on this map. Counters are relatively common, with a more mobile army counterattacking into the natural instead of directly engaging a less mobile army pushing along the other path.

          Aztec is a three-player map for the 2010-2011 season of the Shinhan Bank Proleague. As Terran had been struggling on the map, it was modified for Round 5 of Proleague to help balance the TvP match-up.

        <description>
          Roadkill is a map which was added to the iCCup map pack in v33. It is a four player map with low ground mains and high ground nats. Unlike typical 4-player maps, where the players mains are located around the corners of the map, this map uses a similar layout to the map (4) Icarus, where the mains are situated around the midths of the map's sides.

            <description>
              StarCraft is set around the early 26th century. Terran exiles from
              Earth have colonized a distant area of the Milky Way galaxy called
              the Koprulu Sector, having established several governments.
              Eventually, a civil war breaks out and ends with the formation of
              the Terran Dominion.

              However, humanity soon becomes caught in a war between the Protoss
              and the Zerg, which culminates at the end of StarCraft with the death
              of the Zerg leader, the Overmind, on the Protoss homeworld of Aiur.
              Without the Overmind to command, the Zerg rampage mindlessly across
              Aiur, while the cerebrates—the secondary commanders of the
              Swarm—attempt to regain control.

              After the discovery of alien life in the Koprulu Sector, the
              United Earth Directorate (UED) — the international body governing
              Earth — decides to send an expeditionary force to secure the
              sector and prevent the aliens from finding Earth.

              StarCraft®: Remastered upgrades the essential sci-fi strategy
              experience from beginning to end. Welcome back to the original
              game and its award-winning expansion, StarCraft: Brood War.

              We’ve remastered our units, buildings, and environments, improved
              game audio, and broadened our supported resolutions. Illustrated
              interludes bring the struggles and victories of heroes like Artanis,
              Fenix, Tassadar, Raynor and Kerrigan to life like never before.
              Most importantly, the strategy gameplay that StarCraft perfected
              years ago remains unchanged.
