        <description>
          Formerly known as Silver Wing, Fighting Spirit was one of the maps introduced for the 2009-2010 Proleague season. It is by far the most popular map on Fish Server, to the point many casual players will only play Fighting Spirit because it is the only map they have memorized.

          Fighting Spirit is one of the five maps used in the 2009-10 PokerStrategy.com TSL.

        <description>
          At first glance, (Neo) Jade in many ways resembles standard four-corner main base maps like Fighting Spirit or Circuit Breaker, which also share the nearby third base, but NJ does exhibit some notable features of its own. For example, the main is located on a lower elevation, making it vulnerable to attack, particularly from range units. This forces players to take their naturals early lest they run the risk of being contained in their main and fighting up a ramp.[1]

          A long natural ridge connects the natural to the third, making it easy to take an expansion and to defend alongside the natural, because the ramp typically contains reinforcement troops. The main attack path is a single narrow ramp that can be defended if not blocked. While they are easy to take, these thirds have low value gas geysers (only 1500 gas).

        <description>
          Sniper Ridge was a map released in late 2011. Since the release of the revised version a few months later for the 2012 Tving OSL, New Sniper Ridge has largely replaced the original in terms of frequency of use. TLPD records show Sniper Ridge was used approximately 60 times, largely for Proleague games, while New Sniper Ridge has accumulated over 260 games as of October 2014. New Sniper Ridge is one of the more popular maps in terms of organized competitions and show matches.

          In reviewing the cumulative history of games played across TLPD Korean, International, and SOSPA, the map shows remarkable balance between the races:

        <name>815</name>
        <description>
          815 was the first map to introduce small ramps where only small units can pass through. Strategies used on this map were varied greatly due to the uniqueness of the map. Zerg tended to play similarly as on land maps, whereas Terran and Protoss played a more defensive island style games. Even though games tend to be drawn out, rushing and cheesing was also very popular on 815. The map name 815 comes from the date August the 15th (8/15), Liberation Day in Korea.

            <description>
              StarCraft is set around the early 26th century. Terran exiles from
              Earth have colonized a distant area of the Milky Way galaxy called
              the Koprulu Sector, having established several governments.
              Eventually, a civil war breaks out and ends with the formation of
              the Terran Dominion.

              However, humanity soon becomes caught in a war between the Protoss
              and the Zerg, which culminates at the end of StarCraft with the death
              of the Zerg leader, the Overmind, on the Protoss homeworld of Aiur.
              Without the Overmind to command, the Zerg rampage mindlessly across
              Aiur, while the cerebrates—the secondary commanders of the
              Swarm—attempt to regain control.

              StarCraft®: Remastered upgrades the essential sci-fi strategy
              experience from beginning to end. Welcome back to the original
              game and its award-winning expansion, StarCraft: Brood War.

              We’ve remastered our units, buildings, and environments, improved
              game audio, and broadened our supported resolutions. Illustrated
              interludes bring the struggles and victories of heroes like Artanis,
              Fenix, Tassadar, Raynor and Kerrigan to life like never before.
              Most importantly, the strategy gameplay that StarCraft perfected
              years ago remains unchanged.
