            Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans is the real-time fantasy strategy game
            from Blizzard Entertainment that quickly became a best seller.
            Warcraft has not only become a classic, winning many awards, but
            it has set new standards for multiplayer games. Set in the mythic
            kingdom of Azeroth, players are given the task of maintaining a
            thriving economy while building a war machine with which to destroy
            the enemy.

            By playing either the Humans or the Orcs in this saga, two separate
            story lines evolve with 12 scenarios per side telling the tale of
            the battle for Azeroth. From swords to sorcery, all the elements of
            classic fantasy are here to explore: rich forests, dark dungeons
            and bubbling swamps await the stalwart troops amassed to fight for
            dominance. Command many unique armies and creatures including
            Knights, Archers, Clerics, Warlocks, Daemons, Elementals, and the Dead.

            With the death of the Orcish Warchief Blackhand, his underling
            Orgrim Doomhammer was quick to seize control over the most powerful
            of the Orcish forces on Azeroth. Although each day finds other
            factions growing stronger within the chaotic Horde, it seems certain
            that all of the clans will follow Orgrim's plans to hunt down and
            destroy the renegade Azerothiens wherever they choose to run...

            Sir Lothar, in charge of the scattered armies of Azeroth since
            the death of King Llane, has led his people across the Great Sea
            to the shores of Lordaeron. By enlisting the armies of Lordaeron,
            and making new allies in the Elves and Dwarves, a mighty force known
            as the Alliance has been forged. Now, the last of the once great
            armies of Azeroth seek retribution for the loss of their homeland.

            Following the destruction of Azeroth's Dark Portal by the
            victorious Alliance, the orc shaman Ner'zhul took command of the
            remaining Horde on Draenor. There, he plotted to create portals
            to other unspoiled worlds and invade each in turn. To enable the
            rituals for his dimensional conquest, Ner'zhul sent orcish forces
            through his world's intact Dark Portal in search of powerful relics
            on Azeroth. Wary of the Horde's plans, the heroes of the Alliance
            invaded Draenor to end the orcish threat forever. Facing certain
            defeat at the hands of his enemies, Ner'zhul succeeded in opening
            numerous portals to new worlds. The resulting magical stress
            shattered Draenor, trapping many of Azeroth's greatest heroes on
            Outland, the damaged remains of the planet.

            Warcraft II: Battle.net Edition is an Battle.net-enabled version
            of Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, with the expansion
            Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal built in.

            It is essentially the same as Warcraft II, but it allows for usage
            on Battle.net. The game was also ported to be natively supported
            under Windows, unlike the original game which ran under DOS.

            StarCraft is set around the early 26th century. Terran exiles from
            Earth have colonized a distant area of the Milky Way galaxy called
            the Koprulu Sector, having established several governments.
            Eventually, a civil war breaks out and ends with the formation of
            the Terran Dominion.

            However, humanity soon becomes caught in a war between the Protoss
            and the Zerg, which culminates at the end of StarCraft with the death
            of the Zerg leader, the Overmind, on the Protoss homeworld of Aiur.
            Without the Overmind to command, the Zerg rampage mindlessly across
            Aiur, while the cerebrates—the secondary commanders of the
            Swarm—attempt to regain control.

            After the discovery of alien life in the Koprulu Sector, the
            United Earth Directorate (UED) — the international body governing
            Earth — decides to send an expeditionary force to secure the
            sector and prevent the aliens from finding Earth.

            StarCraft®: Remastered upgrades the essential sci-fi strategy
            experience from beginning to end. Welcome back to the original
            game and its award-winning expansion, StarCraft: Brood War.

            We’ve remastered our units, buildings, and environments, improved
            game audio, and broadened our supported resolutions. Illustrated
            interludes bring the struggles and victories of heroes like Artanis,
            Fenix, Tassadar, Raynor and Kerrigan to life like never before.
            Most importantly, the strategy gameplay that StarCraft perfected
            years ago remains unchanged.
