        In a remote kingdom, the battle between the Orcs and Humans took place
        atop a huge creature. Created from the eldritch energies unleashed by
        Medivh during the birth of the Dark Portal, a giant, carnivorous beetle
        roamed the lands of Azeroth. Destroying ancient forests to satisfy its
        voracious appetite and crushing all that stood in it's path, the beetle
        became a menace to both the noble armies of the seven kingdoms and the
        savage green-skinned invaders. In an awesome display of sorcery, the likes
        of which have not been seen to this day, the great creature was polymorphed
        by the mages of the Violet Citadel just as the Orcish Death Knights
        unleashed a massive barrage of Decay spells. The result was the death
        and transformation of the beast into what is now known as Beetle Island.

        Once the greater threat was destroyed, the two armies quickly set upon
        each other again, of course...

        Towering over the fetid swamps of Draenor, the Brokenrock Mountains have
        long been a vital source of gold. The precious metal, sought after by the
        Orcish clans to fuel their rampaging war machines, has always been a prize
        worth fighting for. While an age old pact between the clans grants members
        of the Horde equal access to the vast riches of the mines, clan chieftains
        occasionally attempt to seize control of the entire mountain range for
        themselves. These greed-driven leaders learn all too soon that the
        "specialized mining techniques" of the Goblin Sappers has made the mountain
        passes very difficult to hold...

        The mountain ranges of Lordaeron hold many unique and mysterious treasures,
        and the valley below Griffon’s Roost is one of the more spectacular.
        Surrounded on all sides by extremely steep cliffs, the valley was
        accidentally discovered when a Dwarvish Flying Machine was blown off course
        during an unexpected storm. Expeditions have been sent overland to explore
        the valley, but the foreboding crags and horrific ice storms that sweep over
        the area have claimed the lives of many who would chart this remote place.

            <description>
              Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans is the real-time fantasy strategy game
              from Blizzard Entertainment that quickly became a best seller.
              Warcraft has not only become a classic, winning many awards, but
              it has set new standards for multiplayer games. Set in the mythic
              kingdom of Azeroth, players are given the task of maintaining a
              thriving economy while building a war machine with which to destroy
              the enemy.

              By playing either the Humans or the Orcs in this saga, two separate
              story lines evolve with 12 scenarios per side telling the tale of
              the battle for Azeroth. From swords to sorcery, all the elements of
              classic fantasy are here to explore: rich forests, dark dungeons
              and bubbling swamps await the stalwart troops amassed to fight for
              dominance. Command many unique armies and creatures including
              Knights, Archers, Clerics, Warlocks, Daemons, Elementals, and the Dead.

              With the death of the Orcish Warchief Blackhand, his underling
              Orgrim Doomhammer was quick to seize control over the most powerful
              of the Orcish forces on Azeroth. Although each day finds other
              factions growing stronger within the chaotic Horde, it seems certain
              that all of the clans will follow Orgrim's plans to hunt down and
              destroy the renegade Azerothiens wherever they choose to run...

              Sir Lothar, in charge of the scattered armies of Azeroth since
              the death of King Llane, has led his people across the Great Sea
              to the shores of Lordaeron. By enlisting the armies of Lordaeron,
              and making new allies in the Elves and Dwarves, a mighty force known
              as the Alliance has been forged. Now, the last of the once great
              armies of Azeroth seek retribution for the loss of their homeland.

            <description>
              Following the destruction of Azeroth's Dark Portal by the
              victorious Alliance, the orc shaman Ner'zhul took command of the
              remaining Horde on Draenor. There, he plotted to create portals
              to other unspoiled worlds and invade each in turn. To enable the
              rituals for his dimensional conquest, Ner'zhul sent orcish forces
              through his world's intact Dark Portal in search of powerful relics
              on Azeroth. Wary of the Horde's plans, the heroes of the Alliance
              invaded Draenor to end the orcish threat forever. Facing certain
              defeat at the hands of his enemies, Ner'zhul succeeded in opening
              numerous portals to new worlds. The resulting magical stress
              shattered Draenor, trapping many of Azeroth's greatest heroes on
              Outland, the damaged remains of the planet.

              Warcraft II: Battle.net Edition is an Battle.net-enabled version
              of Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, with the expansion
              Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal built in.

              It is essentially the same as Warcraft II, but it allows for usage
              on Battle.net. The game was also ported to be natively supported
              under Windows, unlike the original game which ran under DOS.

              StarCraft is set around the early 26th century. Terran exiles from
              Earth have colonized a distant area of the Milky Way galaxy called
              the Koprulu Sector, having established several governments.
              Eventually, a civil war breaks out and ends with the formation of
              the Terran Dominion.

              However, humanity soon becomes caught in a war between the Protoss
              and the Zerg, which culminates at the end of StarCraft with the death
              of the Zerg leader, the Overmind, on the Protoss homeworld of Aiur.
              Without the Overmind to command, the Zerg rampage mindlessly across
              Aiur, while the cerebrates—the secondary commanders of the
              Swarm—attempt to regain control.

              StarCraft®: Remastered upgrades the essential sci-fi strategy
              experience from beginning to end. Welcome back to the original
              game and its award-winning expansion, StarCraft: Brood War.

              We’ve remastered our units, buildings, and environments, improved
              game audio, and broadened our supported resolutions. Illustrated
              interludes bring the struggles and victories of heroes like Artanis,
              Fenix, Tassadar, Raynor and Kerrigan to life like never before.
              Most importantly, the strategy gameplay that StarCraft perfected
              years ago remains unchanged.
